### Hi 👋 I’m Anna Chaykovsky

**Backend Engineer | Cloud & AI-Driven Development | Python & Go**

With about 3 years of industry experience, I’ve been building software since I was a kid — what started as curiosity turned into a career centered around backend engineering, cloud architectures, and (lately) practical applications of AI and ML in real systems.

---

### 🔭 What I’m working on now  
I build backend services in **Python** and **Go**, with a strong focus on **AWS**, clean architecture, security, and maintainability.  
My recent projects combine backend engineering with **AI-assisted tooling**, automation, and early-stage ML/NLP exploration.

Examples from my repos include:  
- **Backend microservices** (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, Docker)  
- **Cloud-native components** (AWS Lambda, S3 pipelines, event-driven systems)  
- **Data tools & personal utilities** (portfolio analytics, stream processing, automations)  
- **Explorations into ML/NLP** and AI-powered developer workflows  

---

### 🤖 AI Tools I Actively Use  
I integrate AI into my daily development workflow to improve speed, readability, and code quality:

- **GitHub Copilot** — for rapid prototyping, refactors, tests, and documentation  
- **Cursor** — for context-aware suggestions, repo-wide reasoning, and faster iteration  
- **AI-powered code review & static analysis** — keeping code clean, secure, and consistent  
- Experimenting with **ML/NLP** to understand how to embed AI capabilities into backend systems  

AI doesn’t replace engineering fundamentals — I use it to **amplify** them.

---

### 🌱 What I’m learning  
To grow as a backend engineer with strong AI capabilities, I’m currently focused on:

- Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Deep Learning & NLP (practical, applied use cases)  
- Cloud-native ML patterns and MLOps  
- Distributed systems, observability, and production-ready design  
- Clean architecture & testing best practices  

---

### 🛠 Tech stack I work with  
**Languages:** Python, Go  
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3, Redis, EventBridge)  
**Data / ML:** Pandas, NumPy, baseline ML workflows, real-world experimentation  
**Dev Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Cursor, Copilot, pytest  
**Practices:** Clean code, TDD, security-first development, performance-minded design  

---

### 💡 I’m interested in collaborating on  
- Backend systems enhanced with ML or AI-driven logic  
- Data-driven products and smart automation  
- Developer tools, AI-powered workflows, or cloud infrastructure projects
