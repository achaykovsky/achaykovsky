### Hi there 👋, my name is Anna Chaykovsky

#### I am a software developer and I have a B.Sc in Computer Science.

#### Over the past two years, I have been working as a Backend Engineer in Python and a wide variety of AWS services.

I've been passionate about coding since I was 12 and a real computer geek even before that!

Strongly believe that a good software engineer loves and enjoys it!
So that's what I do: I love to solve complex problems, using code.

Skills: Python / Go / Java / Software Engineering / Machine Learning

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cool project! 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on K8S.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Software Engineering / ML / DL / NLP projects.

- 📫 How to reach me: 	achaykovsky.career@gmail.com
