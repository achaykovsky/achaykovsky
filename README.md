### Hi 👋 I’m Anna Chaykovsky

**Backend Engineer | Cloud & AI-Assisted Development | Python & Go**

With about 3 years of industry experience, I’ve been building software since I was 12 — what began as curiosity grew into a profession centered on backend engineering, cloud architectures, and ongoing exploration of AI/ML.

### 🔭 What I’m working on  
I build backend services in **Python** and **Go** with emphasis on **AWS**, clean architecture, security, and automation.

Recent work includes:
- Backend microservices (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, Docker)  
- Cloud-native components (AWS Lambda, S3 pipelines, event-driven systems)  
- Data tools & personal utilities (portfolio analytics, stream processing, automations)  
- Early ML/NLP experimentation and AI-augmented workflows  

### 🤖 AI tools I actively use  
I integrate AI into my development workflow to improve speed, readability, and code quality:

- **GitHub Copilot** — rapid prototyping, refactoring, and tests  
- **Cursor** — context-aware reasoning and repo-wide guidance  
- AI-driven code review & static analysis tools  

AI doesn’t replace engineering fundamentals — it **amplifies** them.

### 🌱 Currently learning  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning fundamentals  
- NLP concepts and practical experimentation  
- Cloud-native ML patterns / MLOps  
- Distributed systems, observability, and production-focused design  

### 🛠 Tech stack  
**Languages:** Python, Go  
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3, Redis, EventBridge)  
**Data / ML:** Pandas, NumPy, experimental ML workflows  
**Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Cursor, Copilot, pytest  
**Practices:** Clean code, testing, security-first development  

### 💡 Collaboration interests  
- Backend systems enhanced with ML/AI  
- Data-driven products and automation  
- Developer tools and cloud infrastructure projects  

### ⚡ Fun fact  
I love learning languages — I speak Hebrew, Russian, and English, and I’m studying Spanish, Korean, and Yiddish.
